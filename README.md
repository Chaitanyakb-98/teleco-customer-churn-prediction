# Teleco Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn for a telecom company using data science and machine learning techniques. Understanding the factors influencing churn can help telecom companies take preventive actions to retain customers.

## Project Objective
The main objective is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers likely to churn, helping the telecom provider focus on retention strategies for these individuals.

## Dataset
- **Attributes:** The dataset includes customer details like tenure, usage patterns, and demographics.
- **Target Variable:** The churn status (indicating whether a customer left or stayed).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values to prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing patterns in data features to understand correlations and key factors contributing to churn.
3. **Modeling:** Building and tuning several machine learning models, including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forests
   - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs)
4. **Evaluation:** Models are evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.

## Key Findings
- Feature importance analysis reveals that factors like contract type, customer tenure, and monthly charges play significant roles in predicting churn.
- The final model achieved high accuracy and good balance across precision and recall, making it suitable for identifying churn-prone customers.

## Installation
